# Visit Prep transfer manifest

Execution started October 1, 2026 on `codex/visit-prep-integration` in a fresh
checkout of `CosmaNeura/cosmaneura`. The base and remote `master` were verified
at `bc9da3478de0e03bacac0b81495ea43956c51279`. The source is the same repository,
at `d80a37012526d96991db25920797457c392231a8` in the old Visit Prep checkout.
Existing dirty checkouts have not been adopted or changed.

The approved scope is in [the integration plan](visit-prep-integration.md).
Transfers use committed source and preserve the repository's existing license.

| Recovered behavior | Source files | Destination and adaptation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Question definitions, normalization, seeded content, publication validation | `app/services/visit_prep_question_sets.py` | Extract pure rules into `visit_prep_question_definitions.py`. Require five topics and an unconditional final `story`; preserve `default.v1` content and fingerprint. |
| Physician-owned drafts, immutable versions, default selection, replay and locking | Same service; `tests/services/visit_prep_question_sets_test.py`; `tests/integration/visit_prep_question_publish_lock_test.py` | Recover lifecycle service and tests. Check current membership access state and use the current locked-seat factory. Re-export definitions for existing callers. |
| Provider question API | `app/routes/visit_prep.py`; `tests/routes/visit_prep_question_sets_test.py` | Register under current internal API; reuse existing Visit Prep gates. Retain non-disclosing denials and explicit serialization; add no-store responses and suppress sensitive exception chains. Adapt FastAPI nested-route inspection. |
| Question editor | `web/app/components/visit-prep/QuestionSetSettings.tsx` and its tests | Mount in current settings using server eligibility; label the final open-ended topic and validate it. Generate SDK from the current backend rather than copying old generated code. |
| Additional narrative coverage | New work based on John's October 1 clarification | Test all three physician prompt examples, block conditional/choice/list publication, preserve the old version through a real API edit/publish cycle. |
| Repeatable validation | Current authority suite's literal synthetic configuration | New owned PostgreSQL runner and test bootstrap. Apply the full current migration graph, block Python network connections, avoid repository-wide Clerk cleanup and database truncation, and optionally export current OpenAPI. |

No schema migration is needed for the question-authoring recovery: current Core
already contains the question-set models and migration `271e4439bff6`. The
complete empty-database migration through `16a6bf2d1539` was exercised locally.

Review increments are dependency ordered: question contract and validation
support; persistence lifecycle; gated API; physician editor. Each must remain
below the repository's 2,000-line and 50-file change budget. The integration
branch retains all increments until the feature is ready for the agreed merge.

Local evidence so far: 120 backend tests passed; 20 frontend tests passed,
including 12 editor tests and eight adjacent Session Prep regressions. Generated
SDK and full frontend typecheck passed. Backend focused typecheck passed.
Commit-specific final evidence belongs in the corresponding draft PRs.

## Remaining recovery and integration

Preparation creation, schedule/credential generations, patient confirmation,
answer revisions, resume/submit, and the patient UI are next. Generate additive
migrations against the current graph; inspect and adapt the old aggregate and
retention triggers rather than copying obsolete migration ancestry.

Synthesis, dashboard package, bounded AI clarification, CAB delivery mechanics,
CosmaBot receiver/adapter, Acuity and SMS/reminders remain implementation work.
Their source inventory is in the approved plan; this manifest does not mark them
as transferred. Pin selected external revisions and record each adaptation here.

Deployment, actual patient messages, cohort activation and workspace retirement
remain separate release decisions. All current runtime release controls remain
off; local evidence is synthetic and does not establish live-service readiness.
